# Project Overview
This project is a TypeScript Node.js application.

## Git Configuration
The Git remote was previously set to an SSH alias (`github.com-personal`) that only worked on the user's local machine. 
It has been updated to a standard HTTPS URL.

### How to push to GitHub:
1. Open the **Shell** tab.
2. Run: `git push -u origin main` (or your branch name).
3. When prompted, use your GitHub username and a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** as the password.

### Note on SSH
Replit does not automatically use your local machine's SSH config. If you prefer SSH, you would need to generate a new key in Replit and add it to your GitHub settings, or use the Replit GitHub Integration (Connector).
